# ghist (Git History Viewer)

Interactive [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual)-based interface for exploring the history of a single file in a git repository, inspired by [pomber/git-history](https://github.com/pomber/git-history).

## Features

- Displays the commits that touched a given file with author and timestamp information.
- Textual widgets with keyboard navigation: use `Left`/`Right` to step through commits and `Up`/`Down` to scroll the diff.
- View commit metadata, message body, and complete diff in the detail pane.
- Page up/down, home/end shortcuts for faster navigation.
- No avatars, no animations â€” just a fast, keyboard-driven TUI.
- Inline diff view with the full file visible: removed lines in red, additions in green.
- Change files on the fly by pressing `F` and typing a new path.

## Installation

The project uses a standard `pyproject.toml` (`setuptools` based). You can run it in-place or install it in an isolated environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Or install a global `ghist` command with [`uv tool`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/):

```bash
uv tool install --from "/path/to/ghist" ghist
```

Uninstall with:

```bash
uv tool uninstall ghist
```

## Usage

Preferred quick-run (no install needed) using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
uv run python -m ghist path/to/git/repo/README.md
```

If you have already installed the project (or prefer the console script), you can run:

```bash
ghist path/to/git/repo/README.md
```

The path must point to a tracked file inside a git repository. Optional flags:

- `--limit`: number of commits to load (defaults to 256).

Inside the interface:
- `Left` / `Right`: move to the previous or next commit.
- `Up` / `Down`: scroll the detail view.
- `F`: load a different file (absolute path or relative to the directory you launched the app from).
- `PgUp` `PgDn`: page navigation.
- `Home` / `End` or `g` / `G`: jump to start/end of the list.
- `q`: quit.

## Development

Use `uv run python -m ghist /absolute/path/to/file` during development for an isolated environment with dependencies resolved automatically.

The Textual UI works best in terminals that support basic color.
